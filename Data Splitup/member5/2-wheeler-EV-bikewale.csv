We all checked the bike's capacity to be 150 km's ( for 1 full charge). now its given only 80 who the hell wants to pay 1 lakh for just 80 km's. We don't need max speed for 70 km. Just 40 km/hr. is more than enough. For better safety. How many accidents need to happen . Worst experience if you expect me to say. Felt cheated.,Daily Commute,Never owned,,1,3,4,,,,4,,1,TVS iQube
Performance is very poor on this bike. The charging problem is a very big thing. Worth money. Don't spend the money on this bike. My bike is standing in the service center of tvs iqube for a long time. I am very disappointed. Nobody can hear me because I purchased this bike.

"I purchased this in April 2022 and the sales staff was clueless about the new vehicle launch in May 2022. I asked specifically if there is a new model coming but they had no idea.
The scooter is well built and has good features but compared to other ev scooters, it lacks a lot. The most important lacking is its range. The offered range is 75 km/charge but the real range in eco mode is approx 50km. It's a huge setback considering there are models in other brands which cost the same but offer a better range. I would advise anybody looking to buy this vehicle to first consult with existing owners.",Daily Commute,< 3 months,< 5000 kms,3,4,4,,2,,5,,2,TVS iQube

"Don't buy this vehicle unless you have a near by tvs iqube service center. You will not get service in any other tvs service centers and there is not many service centers over the country. And you will lose your warranty benefits for any delay in servicing the vehicle.
Once you braked the vehicle in a traffic signal, there is delay in releasing the break and moving the bike.",Daily Commute,6 months-1 yr,< 5000 kms,1,3,4,,1,,3,,2,TVS iQube

"The tvs iqube is supposed to be a game changer for tvs in its ev debut but sadly it is let down by step motherly treatment by tvs itself.
Buying was problematic as tvs as chosen only 4-5 showrooms in all of bangalore to sell iqube. For some reason, showrooms are not enthusiastic about giving test ride, following up, picking calls etc. All the push needs to come from the customer side till they get vehicle delivery. Looks like tvs itself in not eager about selling iqube in big numbers.
The iqube rides very well in city conditions and like a very conventional scooter minus the petrol engine noise and vibrations. No complaints there. No hassles with pillion rider either.
Build quality is not great ..Plastic feel throughout and not the nice kind as well. Gaps between panels are clearly visible. The key fob is a prime example of giving flashiness the upper hand over quality. Mine simply split into two after a few days.
Charging time takes 6-7 hours for 10% to 100% and gives upto 75km riding distance. Good for short distance rides. Charger price is extra, which is plain dumb considering every ev should have a charger in its package. The most cheapest electronic product ships with a charger and tvs chose not to. Clearly the accessory pays more gimmick. Also charging point needs a good earthing presence else vehicle cannot be charged. You will not find this mentioned in showroom.
Vehicle maintenance is not much, just keep tires inflated and use water to clean and that's all it takes.
But the onus is on the owner to keep the vehicle problem-free because iqube service centers are very few and you cannot get it repaired in local garages. You are at the mercy of the tvs service center which can repair it. Tvs having so much local presence already should have at least ensured that iqube can be repaired at any service center. Again this feels deliberate. My nearest service center for iqube is nearly 15 km away but there are more than 8 tvs service centers on the way which do not deal with iqube. Also spares are not compatible with any of their other products.
Another thing is that tvs itself seems perplexed with many of the random things that the scooter does. My vehicle shows up with a ""close throttle warning"" at starting and tvs has not been able to tell why that comes and what the solution is. The only so called solution is to twist the throttle and leave it and hope the warning goes away. Clearly the sensor calibration is what the issue is but they want customer to change the way they drive to solve their problem. I have heard another user say sometimes the battery indicator shows 0% even if there is enough charge and need to restart the vehicle.
Pros:
- decent ev for someone whose daily travel is 50km and has charging facilities at home.
- very good motor. Zippy, zero noise, responsive.
- great handling and suspension and good ground clearance.
- not complicated to use at all even with lots of electronic features.
- easy to maintain.
Cons:
- reliability - range anxiety of ev aside, you never know which sensor might get knocked off on the iqube and the vehicle gets bricked (keep towing services number handy). Tvs should do more customer interaction to know the regular problems faced by users and only then they can solve.
- serviceability is poor. Customer service almost has no knowledge of the scooter working and their only response is to ask the service center to call you.
- takes way to long to charge.
- there is no concept of software upgrade. Awful app.
There is a lot of work for tvs to do with iqube if it wants to be considered a serious ev player. Otherwise, this model will just be a footnote in the ev revolution.",Occasional Commute,6 months-1 yr,< 5000 kms,3,3,2,,2,,4,,3,TVS iQube
"I brought iqube in march 2021 used for about 1400 kms and the motor is dead, The vehicle was dropped at prn motors and its been 25 days now and still the replacement is not done, the display is a waste in the bike, Maps don't work, at least clock I expected and that too is not working. Totally I wasted on such a waste bike. Please don't buy ev scooters with motor in wheel its always a headache.",Daily Commute,< 3 months,< 5000 kms,1,3,1,,1,,2,,1,TVS iQube
"Buying experience - Chennai on road price is 115580/- but they are charging hefty amount on charger cable. Simple charger cable with industrial socket they have priced it as Rs.8260 which should be priced only Rs.2000/- to Rs.3000/-. Tvs has maintained vehicle price equal to competitor but huge margin in chargers and accessories.
Ride comfort with pillion is good and it can be used only for fixed distance usage, like only commuting to office and back to home.
When 100% charged vehicle pick up is good and top speed achieved under power mode 84 km/h, in eco mode top speed is only 52 kmh. But when the power is at less than 70%, eco mode top speed is 44 to 46 km/h only. As per my experience under combination eco & power mode 68% and 32% respectively, the range achieved is 71.9 km with balance 9% charge which shows distance to empty is 7km so approx. total range is 78.9 km. The above range is with regenerative option but we could not see how much regenerative power generated in %, app do not provide any data
Very poor app design and bt connectivity issue continues and reports are not generated for a selected period.
Unnecessarily head light is permanently ""on"", even thought there is one drl, horn sound is worst and not good. They should provide ntorq horn which is louder and good.
Charging time is huge and it takes 6 hours to charge from 9% to 100%, tvs should come out with replaceable battery at least for the under seat battery so we can buy one spare battery and we can use it as reserve power back up option.
The app should provide the details for every trip how much power % consumed and while charging it should provide how much units consumed for every charge
Servicing and maintenance experience not able to comment we have wait and watch, tvs should provide improvements as stated above once they fix the issue to all existing customers especially removable battery option.",Daily Commute,< 3 months,< 5000 kms,3,3,3,,3,,4,,3,TVS iQube

How good the TVS iQube EV scooter is a very much premature stage to claim how good it is in the field conditions. But some of the points to be looked can be discussed as follows. Battery - with it’s 2.2 kw battery it’s more than enough in city ride conditions say for everyday commute. With this power iqube offers a range of 75 km/h which is slightly better than Chinese rebadged scooters from other competitors. Motor power of 4.5 kw offers a better acceleration of 0–40kmph in 4.2 seconds which is slightly better too given the other competitors. A kerb weight of 118 kgs offer better dynamic riding conditions. With the low price tag next to Chetak as 1.15 lakhs is literally a competitive priced EV scooter in India than Ather and other vehicles. A charging time of 4–5 hours is enough for a day's ride with average city riding office to home commute. With geo-fencing and other loaded options vehicle looks cooler and slim compared to the others in market. Personally i would say the final performance and acceptability verdict is to be given by the sales numbers alone. That will really show how good the acceptance rate of the vehicle is.

"We'll, this bike will meet the interests of many Indians, in many factors, excluding a few like riding range and speed. But still, if you're daily riding range is less than 130-120 kms and able to maintain an idle speed of 60 to 70 km/h, then this bike will serve you the best. In terms of braking, combined braking system is provided and it's performing just as much as required. Ergonomics are good, comfort factor is well prioritized by the makers. The bluetooth connectivity is an interesting element which grabs the attention of the youth. Although there are plenty of features on the app which are necessary in the present day, but the throttle sound feature was awesome. That's the feature which makes the bike special when compared to the other ev's in the nation. In terms of electrical vehicles it's worthy to get a new bike as early as possible. The main reason is, governments are encouraging, fuel prices are peaking (even if they get back to normal, prices will rise in the near future), and it's always good to get adapted with the changes.

Awesome ergonomics, built quality looks premium.Although it is an electric bike its safer for our environment also, so i congratulate revolt to bring the future in our reach.

Even built quality also never compromised by revolt.4) high-tech apps features (not all features are disclose as of now, so there should be more premium features letter on ) ex- geo fensing , exhaust sound change , keyless , and riding modes.5) swapping station and battery delivery concept.6) lifetime battery warranty.7) unlimited service by revolt under mrp(my revolt plan).8) though its an electric bike the lower end pick up is heavily high.9) usd(up-side down forks).10) led head drls & projector head lamp.11) led tell lamp.15) fast charging (75% charge in 2.5hour / full charge 4-4.5 hour).16) can be charge at any place with an 15mm port.17) can run up to 150km after one charge.18) cost efficient.Cons:-1) there is no abs.2) lack of speed. (max speed 80km/h)3) weight carrying capacity. (not more than 150kg)4) battery weight is too heavy almost 19-20kg. They said if your bike run out of battery then you can carry the batter charge it and put it back and you good to go. But i don't think it is to carry 20kg.5) it is an electric bike so its initial pick up is very high so you need to be very concerned while rev the acceleration.6) the engine power could be more powerful , overall you making a bike not scooter.(personal opinion).7) bike looks great but very compact which make this look like a toy.8) additional body graphics is missing which i believe can be added.9) the bike has no exhaust sounds, but there is a speaker which produce artificial exhaust sound and it totally understandable that the sound is artificial.Now the questions:-1) should i buy this bike ??Ans :- of course..

3. No doubt there are alot of new features being show cased like remote controlled, push start button, operating bike from mobile phone, changing sound, geo fencing. I believe other features like DRLs are quite common features which are available in every bike now a days.
At the time of taking the test drive of this bike, i was told that you can only start the bike either from a remote or mobile phone and not from a key. They could not answer when I asked them how to start the bike if remote stopped working and my mobile phone is out of battery.
Although, sound coming out from the speaker is an interesting feature, however, maximum sound in itself is not at all loud and thrilling.
My overall experience with representatives at Revolt Showroom was very bad as they were neither welcoming nor were aware about the complete specifications of the bike nor could answer to my queries.
Cannot say much about the ride quality or performance of the bike because representatives only let me ride the bike in a service lane just for 2-3 minutes.
I would give an overall rating of 3 stars to this bike and my overall experience.",Daily Commute,Never owned,,3,3,3,3,3,,3,,,Revolt RV 400

"The biggest issue before going electric is range and performance. The bike is below mediocre in both. Stated range of 100 km is not enough. If we travel 30km to and fro add to it the loss of inefficiency we are staring at 70-80 kms range which would put battery to its limits since stated range is always far fetched. Now lets add realistic assumptions. 1-the sub tropical climate of india with scorching summers of 40+ radically affects battery life and range over years. We are starting at 70% efficiency within 2-3 years at best. Though the decline after initial fall would be slower. Typical reason why most manufacturers prefer liquid cooling for battery. If they don’t for cost savings, stay away for you will pay in future. 2-the battery life also depends on its peak charge and its lower extremity over repeated use. Maintaining a charge of 80% as max would be suitable most of the time and so for downsides of 20% that limits the battery charge usable to 60% for regular days. 60% of 100km - inflated statement (assume 20%) - 2-3 years degradation We are already staying at range of 40-60 kms depending on individuals driving habits and use case. I would happily pay a premium for electric is performance parameters are atleast at par with regular bikes from range to top-speed. I fully understand the economics under play and rate of returns and current bikes of range 100-150 are not worth it. Add to it their limited to speed and rigidity. Waiting for 4th gen products. Remember what happened with smart phones. We barely recall what first few generations looked like until they are good enough to attract our attention.

"Buying experience: not great. While booking the bike, the price was 1.38lacs ( on-road price). They called me after 2 months, and when I asked about the manufacture date, they said it's the last year, I refused to take it. Again I got a call in may to make the payment, for which I paid rs. 1.49 lacs. They said: 1 bike chips are in high demand and 2. Bike prices increased. Now the latest price is rs. 1.51 lacs. They even don't offer a glass of water to their customers forget offering tea/coffee. Once you made the payment, they are taking you for granted.
2. Riding experience: this bike is not fit if your height is less than 167cm. The seat is too hard, and the max. Weight it carries 130 kgs. The riding quality is good.
3. Details about looks, performance etc: looks wise it is good, after you purchase the bike, you need to buy an additional stabilizer ( compulsory) which you need to invest around 3k more.

"So here's something to ponder and consider before you make a purchase of the revolt rv 400.
I had the terrible misfortune of having booked and fully paid for the electric bike.
1. For one, the delivery of the bike is delayed and after claiming 100% amounts in advance
2. But, what I found ridiculous is the following facts:
Did you know they try and sell you an insurance cover, which is much higher priced?
Well, they do and so I got my own insurance and they had to minus the amounts, which they would have otherwise charged
Did you know they literally force down your throats a sub-standard helmet, which is much higher priced, than any helmet currently available on the market?
Now here is what baffled me no end!
The director at koramangala, bangalore, tells me that, he will not deliver my bike unless I, either take the revolt sub-standard helmet at a higher price or produce a recent invoice showing the purchase of a helmet.
Anyways, since I did not like or want the revolt helmet, I proceeded to make a purchase of a helmet I liked.
Then I am told that I need to give them a 'printed' tax invoice.
Now the attachment is the tax invoice that the seller was able to generate; but according to him, this won't do.
So when did a start-up brand in India dictate which helmet I need to use?
What happens if someone already has a better helmet. They cannot get the bike?
When was it that, a start-up brand began forcing us customers to buy anything?
This seems unlawful and must be addressed immediately.
Last but not the least, I do believe a brand will achieve far more with someone better equipped and knowledgeable.",Daily Commute,< 3 months,< 5000 kms,1,,,,,,,,,Revolt RV 400

"Bajaj Chetak has increased the price of their electric scooter for second time without any noticeable up gradation. The first hike was Rs.5000/- and thereafter a whopping hike of Rs.27000/- in March 2021.”Bajaj” is exploiting the trust of Indian customers who are having great faith in this brand. On the contrary, the manufacturer has little sentiments for their trusted customer and encashing every opportunity to swallow the subsidy amount and hard earned money of the buyers. As a thumb rule the production cost goes down with increase in production volume. Then why so frequent and intense price hikes? this is not only the story of Bajaj Chetak, every second electric scooter that gain slightest popularity has adopted the similar strategy, like Ather-450x who did raise a few months back. They have no ethics, no sentiments for environment, country or people. I appeal to general public to boycott their products, there are many other great options available in Indian market, and we just need to give a fair trial to many other new manufacturers.

"I booked ola just to get a test ride by paying an advance of 500. I should say I was bowled over when I did the test ride. I was not serious to buy ola but then when they gave the gerua colour offer on holi, i bought it. From the date of full payment, I got the vehicle in about a month's time. Everything was done through the app. Updates were coming as notifications. However, there was no way to know the real-time information about the delivery status. It was carefully packed while delivering but the number plate was already bent.
It is the silence during the ride that I like the most. No sound from the motor, just the new tyre sounds. Pickup is amazing. Whenever we decide we can easily accelerate and pass other vehicles.
The look is the same as etergo the netherland scooter. The only con with the looks is that it looks like a scooty and not a scooter. The under-seat capacity is good enough to hold my laptop if I leave the charger and other items behind. The range is about 90 km. There was a sudden drop to 0 in just 10 seconds and the vehicle switched off when the range was still showing 45 km. They claim a true range of 135 km for s1 pro but that is not true. I had to get that towed to my home taking their roadside assistance but it took me 6 hours to get the scooter home. I am doing a hard reset of the s/w as instructed by them every other day so that the display will show the right range. There will be a loss of about 5% battery every night when you are not charging. There is a slight lag in the pickup initially but then it moves fast. The reverse mode gives a push and doesn't respond for a few seconds. Again another push and then gets cut off. It is safer this way compared to the complaints I hear from other customers of over-speeding in the reverse mode and going forward when reversing.
I have not gone for a service or maintenance. It is still new - I have driven about 400 km so far. Their customer care was friendly and helpful. They followed up a couple of times after the issue was resolved. I am still awaiting the upgrade of the software version which will have all the other features that were promised for s1 pro - cruise control, hill control, Bluetooth, navigation, etc. Hyper charging stations are yet to be installed in bangalore. The front shocks are making me worry because there is a noise and there are complaints of this breaking when negotiating speed breakers.
Overall, this is a good and ambitious scooter project which failed miserably. Ola has to re-brand its scooter and earn customer loyalty to remain in the market. Significant pros are the looks, under-seat capacity, and display system. Cons are unfirm rear grips, useless front leg room (you can't keep your grocery box or bag there due to the central hump), flimsy side stand (center stand is not a possibility by design), and not useful for saree-clad women on the rear - no footrest for them, control buttons are difficult to reach.",Occasional Commute,< 3 months,< 5000 kms,3,4,2,4,4,,4,,,OLA S1 Pro

Payment process : was one of the first early adopters - reserved her for 500 on july 23. 2 months later, paid an advance of 20k, and got an invite to take the test ride 15 days later. Paid the final amount in October, and received the delivery window of December 15-31. The ola representative called in December end for final confirmation and soon received the intimation of insurance and registration payment from icici lombard and rto respectively. Home delivered in a mini truck.
Idv on insurance : 155400
Actual cost : 197400 (ex showroom 163549, smart card - 200, postal fee - 50, registration - free, zero dep insurance - 7632, portable charger - 9000, performance upgrade - 17000)
Fame ii subsidy : 59550 (15000 per kwh - 15000*3.97)
Maharashtra state subsidy : 29850 (5000 per kwh - 5000*3.97 = 19850 + 10000 additional)
Total subsidy discount : 89400
Effective on road price : 108000
Real world range : 135 kms in normal, 120 km in sports, 95 km in hyper
Arai claimed range : 181 kms
Design language : a big fan, front leds are as powerful as a dominar's and cute like wall e's face! it's parent company etergo won the german design award in 2020, so there's that too! floorboard isn't flat, but compensates by providing a 36lt boot space, that can fit 2 half face helmets, and 1 full face ls2 ece helmet sideways. Turn indicators chime through the in built speakers. Display is 7"". Stock horn is typical road runner type (90s kids relate?)
Riding : very agile, planted in corners, thick 120 section mrfs provide good grip. Seat height is 790mm and well padded and you sit taller than the traffic (i'm 6 feet). Motor whines while accelerating (it's addictive). The bugs of the beta software have been fixed, and now the scooter runs a stable os.
Performance : 0-40 : 3 seconds, 0-60 : 5 seconds, top speed : 115 kmph, torque : 58nm (accelerates in hyper mode arguably as fast as a dominar 400/ duke 250)
Charging : likes to take it in the ass through a 750w portable charger. Charging time : 6.5 hours. 6amp connection taken from home.
Running costs : 4.54km/rupee or rs. 0.22/km. In comparison, a bike returning 35 km/l at 105/litre equals rs.3/km
Battery warranty : 3 years
Battery life : 7 years (claimed)
Battery replacement cost : Rs. 60000 (info provided by technician, subject to drop in price as adoption increases)
Niggles : delivery date was pushed by 4 days, but guess have to give ola credit for innovation, so no complaints.

"Let's start it from its exterior. The ola s1 pro has got fabric body and the battery part is metallic finish to protect the battery. The ola s1 pro has got all led lights including indicators, headlamp, taillamp and the s1 pro has got 2 led headlamps and you can choose to light up 1 or both. Coming to the touch screen of s1 pro, the touch screen has got all information regarding the s1 pro the speed, battery, km driven, km left to drain battery and also it got a bluetooth connectivity for maps. BTW it has a offline map also for attending calls, cutting the calls. The s1 pro have 2 speakers, could you believe it. You can listen songs by bluetooth connectivity on them and the s1 pro has got a usb socket also and the utlity space on both the knee sides. Now moving on to the top speed of s1 pro. OMG, the first scooter I have ever seen which reaches 110-115 km/h easily. It has got 3 modes normal, sport, hyper. Whenever you switch modes from normal the screen shows you the decreasing battery which is normal. The full capacity of full charge running of s1 pro is approx 180 kms which is awesome. Now let's move to the boot space, It has got very huge boot space. You can easily fit 2 helmets on it. Now moving to the looks, touchwood the ola s1 pro is very good looking and premium scooter. You get alloys and both disc brakes.. In my opinion it is the best smart electric scooter available in India with decent price.. The price of s1 pro is approx 1,20000 INR.

"Bought an ola during the holi window.
Procedural time is understandable. Delivery was pathetic there was a dispute between the transporter and truck owner the vehicle was helped up on the truck for 3 days. The rep was rude but answered the mobile.
Riding the scooter has power alright. Was disappointed there is no navigation preinstalled. The rep says there will be a software update. There is a scraping sound when above 35km/hr also there is a vibration that you can feel on the foot if you wear chappals. Called the company rep and he said to ride for 500km if still there to call customer care. Overhaul I'm concerned about the vibration it's 200km and still, both are there.

The looks of this bike are very much different from other EVs its eye-catching, cool looks with multiple color options to choose from.
Can't talk about the performance.
Now coming to the servicing part I think the OLA is on the trails and errors stage and the base is not set yet to resolve the issues of its riders and customers but I believe that they will come up with the resolutions very soon for the issues which their customers are facing.
Pros-
Firstly it is an EV.
Amazing looks.
Cons-
Launched in Dec-2021 in cold weather, yet to experience till this summer ends that how many more complaints to be seen and also should get ready for Mumbai rainy season to come.
-It Will be more helpful for its riders if they keep the availability of their spare parts and prompt service.

"1. Buying experience: they really made us wait for a very long period, took 2 months more than the promised delivery date.
2. Riding: it is just amazing and the top speed on paper is 115 km/h but in real in turbo mode, it gives a top speed of 70km/h and the charging time is not so much because when we see the range after 100% charging the vehicle it gives a range of 135 kms. The charging time is 7 to 7.30 hours.
3. Looks and performance: amazing looks and superb performance.
4. Pro: ride quality and eco friendly, pick up too good, comfortable for 2 people, has a large boot space, built quality is very good.
5. Con:
A) the functional buttons are very difficult to operate.(horn, turn indicator etc)
B) manual key lock is necessary
C) back number plate often hits the leg
D) side stand quality could have been better.
E) horn sound is very inadequate.
F) in real-life conditions it gives only 100 to 130 kms for one full charge(s1 pro)
F) fast-charging stations and not available
G) you cannot hold the brakes and accelerate the bike.

"I booked s1 pro on dussera 2021 with an expectation to be delivered by the year-end, booking amount was 500 rs so wasn't much wishful, as I booked a tesla model 3 on 2016 which is never delivered in India (1000 usd booking). Anyways was surprised to receive a mail near holi to make final payments and my scooter will be delivered by may end. I was excited and made full payment and they did abide by the promise.
The delivery experience was smooth and coordinated and I faced no hassles in getting delivered at home in nagpur apart from a last-minute glitch of having the wrong scooter delivered but it was an honest mix-up as both same colors and assigned for a similar area. The initial impression of the scooter was very negative, having owned a honda dio for over a decade I was at least expecting my helmet to fit in the trunk which, despite being spacious wasn't the right size for storing my regular-sized helmet. And where is the center stand? it's an absolute must but if they did for the sensor and software issue. At least they had provision for the same and I got an aftermarket stand installed separately.
The driving experience is definitely an upgrade from traditional ice - the ride height, suspension system, dual disc brakes, wide and comfortable seats, and peppy motor make it check all boxes in the ride quality section. Its looks are unique and definitely head turner! software is another matter however ev makes it 40% software and 60% hardware. And the software is buggy - the charge level problems, occasional lags in the interface, and delay in promised updates do not look good on ola's books.
I haven't faced any maintenance needs and do not expect any necessity to service since there aren't any mechanical parts. The range is great and I do manage to get about 135-140 on a single charge as promised true range. Perhaps if I use regen braking more aggressively I may be able to manage more juice out of it, but I don't feel the need since I mostly cruise and only use it for leisure travels.

1. You need to charge it regularly and manage it well. If you can't manage the vehicle by charging it regularly or forget often to charge, don't buy this vehicle.

"This is my honest review after riding for 7500 km and 9 months.
I bought this bike in Aug 2021. The buying experience was not that great, but all that faded out in the excellent performance and quality of this bike. The riding experience was amazing. What I found was Ather has tested this bike in most Indian conditions and it is well suited for Indian roads. Looks are undoubtedly sporty, performance is superb has mentioned in numbers in the website.
I had done one service after 5000 km, it cost me some 1200 rs. No maintenance charges except service.
Pros.
1. Excellent Performance
2. Looks
3. No maintenance except servicing
4. Service cost is low
5. Riding experience
6. Useful OTA updates
Cons.
1. Price is comparatively high
2. Buying experience is not impressive
3. Range is 90 km. Which would have been 150km for the daily commute.",Daily Commute,6 months-1 yr,5000-10000 kms,5,5,5,5,5,,4,,,Ather 450X

Company claims wrong figures about its mileage of 55 km/battery. My bike never gave me more then 45 km/battery. Company is fooling its customer through false claims. 2. Poor material of critical components like motor and battery. I already touched upon initial battery response. After a year, bike is giving less then 30 km on a full charge. The motor of bike has got damaged within a year. Both are covered under 3-year warranty, but support too is horrible. 3. Customer support is horrible. Even after 15 days of issue identification, company hasn't still replaced motor and battery that ere covered under a 3 year warranty. I reached out to their engineer many times a day, but no response from him. He neither picks up the calls, nor responds on what's-app. All the good will of hero motor corp is getting damaged because of this company (hero electric) and its employees.

Bought it amidst lockdown. Congratulations to hero electric for venturing into the field of riding with zero emission. Really appreciate such moves. Riding experience is good. Better suited for single riding rather than double carrying.. The battery of vrla model doesn't charge fully below 12 hours. Moreover the capacity of the motor to perform at battery levels below 30% is really poor. So after a maximum of 40kms one needs to recharge it for full performance.

"Do not buy e-scooty , otherwise you will suffer . I am writing this review after using middle of 2016 . Worst battery service . Stock battery dies within 1 year and 2 months . I did not use 8 months thereafter . Then I installed new set of battery middle of 2018 and wished this time more careful about battery than before . But what a bog mistake . Now again I am suffering . New battery dies again within 1 year only . Let me clear that I am very careful about battery . I never charged it to the load of 100% . I always charged less than 100% . I never loaded my scooty to much because I was fearful about over-load damage . I always discharged it fully before charge again .

2) Riding experience is totally worst. Everything is made up of plastic and which is of worst quality. Within few months many noises will arise and lock problem which I had to change within 2 months by paying 1200 rs.
3) Looks is not so good compared to petrol bikes and performance is worst. You buy a bike to save money but actually you should have invested in a petrol bike because parts of this bike is costly.
4) Servicing and maintenance is always ready. As soon as you reach the showroom they will say some parts are broken which is not in warranty and ask you to pay, costly to maintain this bike.

I don't use the full 100 km's. I charge after every 60 to 70 km's. Charging takes just 2 hour's plus. That's because a lithium ion battery should not be charged 100 percent and should not be drained completely. I let the bike roll as much as it can and I use the throttle sparingly. Look wise the bike has a lovely cute look. I love it. Till now no maintenance. At 100 km's approx. per charge, I will get back my investment in maximum 1 year.

People could be weaned away from the false idea of meaningless speed, wastage of power and money - and the consequent inevitable 'eco-pollutions'...It will be wonderful if its range per charge could be enhanced.

If you are buying then be careful while driving, i met with an small accident and the condition of the bike was worst due to its plastic body. And one more thing it takes around 8-9 hrs for charging and last till just 30-45 km(not more than that according to me). When it was new there was no footrest for keeping legs but now may be company is allowing.Well it's maintenance is not that hard just to charge and keep it clean.

"Recently i have purchased a magnus ex bike from Indore and after using it i have some feedback for this bike,
1. There should be an option with a 12-inch tire size as roads are very poor in our area and 12-inch tires increase the ground clearance for bikes. As per our area road conditions minimum of 155+ mm, ground clearance is required.
2. Seat is not fitted correctly on boot space, have checked many bikes at the dealer showroom, looks like the seat lock will be damaged after using the bike for one or two months. Feels a very low-quality part of the entire bike, even sometimes boot space light keeps on after closing the boot space because the seat is not fitted properly.
3. When we apply break on speed breaker, the bike suddenly stops and then has to again push the accelerator and the bike moves ahead with a jerk.
4. Charger pin which we insert into the battery can be better if someone does not point the pin correctly and try to push in the battery in that case charger pin can be damaged.
5. Okay with a 3-year warranty for the bike's main components, but distance should be increased for warranty condition, expecting 35,000+ km's warranty instead of 20,000 km as per the price and range of the bike.
Have few more points but these are the main problems with this bike which should be resolved as soon as possible if these problems are solved then it will be a rough and tough bike for all types of indian conditions and users.

Pros: frond look wise it's pretty good and we cannot make out its ev from the front side
Boot space is decent we can keep the half helmet.
Cons: 121 km is just a dream...The actual range is 80 with a single person and low mode. If we are riding pillion then max rage would be 50 to 60
Tyre's profile is 10 inches and the worst quality... No disk brake was given and braking efficiency is poor.
Speed is a big concern..Max speed is 50. You cannot overtake any petrol scooter on road ..40 to 47 is the max speed... If you want to reach 50 then u have to struggle
Charging time 5 to 6 hours..It's quite long and no fast charging option
Made quality is average...Within 1-month usage, starter switch was damaged..Even low/high mode switch made with 20 rs plastic.
People were attracted by the look and the company claimed 121 range...Plz don't believe that word that's never got it ...After buying dealer told me about the actual range ...

Servicing required as per km driven. Can tolerate Indian road conditions with minimum service. Looks very good on the road. Not like a typical electric scooter.

It is so silent; it does have initial grunt or a kind of adrenaline induced jerk that all make proud. The handling is quite nimble but the ride quality is bumpy due to its skinny tyres.
Certainly after making a trip to market or so, it feels happy that i didn't spent lavishly in a petrol bunk. In contrast, as there is no indicator for warning us how much distance that it can commute, it gives a little fear that whether would it make it pull manually to home back.
Two things need to be addressed soon. The in-between acceleration must be increased, otherwise, it will definitely let you on the middle of the road.

Looks and performance:- look is not that good, because, battery can be seen from rear tyre side. Seat height of vehicle is less than that of activa. Since maximum speed scooter can deliver is only 45km/h, so one can't overtake which moves at 40km speed.
Servicing:- actually no major service is required for the vehicle, even though, to pay some amount to the dealer, paid service intervals added in periodic services.
Pros and cons:-
Pros:- powerful electric scooter at lower price. This electric scooter good for ladies. Suitable for travel on flat good roads
Cons:- not suitable for tall men. Even not suitable for men, who require some speed and want to overtake a vehicle. Will feel back pain during long rides. Turning radius is more. Some times at full accelerator throttle, scooter moves half of its half maximum speed. We need to decrease the throttle and the increase it, then only it achieves maximum speed.",Daily Commute,< 3 months,< 5000 kms,3,3,4,3,4,2,,4,,Hero Electric Photon

"Review will be quite bigger but its worth it, i hope,I strongly believed in hero electric , but bit disappointed on the vehicle i got, due to some problems in it. But will keep updating whether it got rectified or not & also the bikes performance in diff timelines in upcoming months.I bought this bike, hero electric photon (li model) on 10/11/2018 in erode dealership, but they delivered from another dealer due to stock unavailability. In hero electric showrooms i visited, all the staffs are decent and speaks/behaves well with customer. But they lack deep knowledge about the bikes they sell. Lesser than what i got to know while researching on choosing a good e-scooter. Also, most of the dealers don’t have vehicles for test drive(especially photon not for display also, they don’t have stock itself). This is a bigger disadvantage for both company and customers. I went to 4 dealers in 3 different cities chennai (2 dealers), erode, trichy but they don’t have stock of photon li/photon itself.I preferred photon li model for its detachable lithium ion batteries. But its too difficult to remove batteries from vehicle. The seat plastic, covers the battery power pin/socket, so its difficult to remove the pin and lift battery. It is a major shock for me, if there was a test drive vehicle or display vehicle i would have got to know about it earlier and would have opted for some other vehicle. But i saw the vehicle for first time on delivery day only. If you are staying in apartment/ place without proper electric connection boxes in parking, then don’t opt this bike (till there is an updated version where they rectify this) as it is so difficult to remove batteries and charging it inside your home. You have to charge it with vehicle only.Then, the bike i took have following problems which disappointed me hugely. I believed in hero electric. It might be basic or small issues but facing it on first day, that too when u r travelling from dealership to home on first ride. Its so bad. Problem 1: dealership to my home is 60 kms(nearby districts). In middle of journey first battery got over and we switched to second one using the switch given under seat for changing battery from 1 to 2. After which bike didn’t started, for nearly 15 mins we struggled in middle of road and it started off by itself. Same problem occurred on day 3 also while switching from 1st battery to 2nd. Again struggled in middle of road for 20 mins Problem 2: suddenly sometimes motor is not working on acceleration. Everything else is working, from horn, headlight, indicators all are working. But if i accelerate, there is no power to motor, vehicle is not moving. I checked brake also, its not locked and brake light is off only. It happened 7 times in 3 days. In middle of road, in traffic, near home in different circumstances.Problem 3: i observe sound is coming while i stop accelerating or if i brake, its not from motor and not due to friction in tyres. But from front disc i hope. Its odd, in an electric vehicle on my first ride, a strange uncomfortable sound.Apart from these, a connector is not mounted, battery level indicator is not accurate, battery charged fully then also adapter showing red light, i have to unplug and plug again to check whether its full or not. Upon unplugging and plugging back its turning to green if charged. Adapter also have problem i hope. Remote alarm/lock ll serve only as anti-theft alarm, don’t expect more in it. Storage space below seat is bit less compared to petrol scooters, due to batteries occupying the space. Quality, look & mechanism of the plastic separator that separates battery and storage space under seat is not good. Quality of plastics used have to be improved a bit.Pros: 1) bike’s look is good. Its simple and decent.2) its really comfortable to ride, seats are spacious, foot space is good, easy to handle, less weight. Riding comfort is good, can be compared with top selling petrol bikes.3) head light is good enough.4) indicator can be turned off by a centre switch in indicator button which made t easier.5) smooth ride, no noise/vibration ( exception :my defective vehicle)6) speed and pick up is good compared to other evs. Can zip through city traffic easily. Achieves 50 kmph in flat or downside roads. 40 to 45 while climbing up (like flyovers). If compared to petrol counterparts, its bit downside in terms of pickup and speed. But more than enough for town or city commutes. 7) with two riders also its performance is good.(though there will be slight change,only slight). It can go up to 40 to 45 kmph with two riders in flat roads & 30-35 kmph with two riders while climbing up (like flyovers)8) braking is good, as supply will cut off once u apply brake. So braking quick and good. finally, keeping the problems in my bikes aside (hoping that these problems occurred only in my bike) , its a good choice as of now for city , town or less distance commutes. One main thing hero electric need to update in this model is making its battery removal easier. But we have to check the vehicle thoroughly before taking delivery to avoid facing problems as mine. So that you wont regret your decision on buying it, as everything else is fine/manageable except battery removal. coming to my bike: i don't know how such a faulty vehicle(which i got) was allowed till delivery. Do they (hero electric) have any quality checks or preventive measures for such cases. Expecting a mechanic in a day from dealership as promised by them. Ll update after they service the vehicle.",Daily Commute,< 3 months,< 5000 kms,2,4,3,,3,,4,,4,Hero Electric Photon

"I found equal merits and demerits in Okinawa Praise Pro.
Pros:-
-Front Space
-Good pickup
-Satisfactory speed ( Actual 55-60)
-Range- Never expect more than 80km (actual) in any case.
-Comfortable seating
-Full charge timing:- Never took more than 3.5 hrs.
Cons:-
-Worst part of okinawa scooters are Speedometer or Odometer ( It shows 10km more than actual speed and consequently it counts the trip kilometres.
2. There are two horn switch. None of the switch loaction is as per your thumb.
3. Range could be better as I was expected 100km (actual)
4. Central Government Subsidy looks like Scam. Company assured that they have reduced those subsidy from Ex-show room as shown on the website. Thus, cost of the Model Praise Pro is approx 90k in Delhi. This is little expensive as compared.

"This might be a bit long.
Okinawa is the china set for scooter. They should rebrand themselves as sigmatel.
This is a cheap chinese scooter rebranded as indian, the charger and internals are written in chinese. Why tell lies, if it's made in china say so, why the subterfuge. It's most likely manufactured in china and assembled in India. This is like old tech 2014-15 hero electric kind of scooter. So much for make in India and boycott china.
Weak plastic body is see-through in sunlight, poor headlight visibility is barely 10 meter in dark it's dangerous to ride this as potholes or people aren't visible. The disk brakes are bad and it's constantly rubbing eating battery and brake pads.
Lead acid battery lasts 6000kms only costs 30k to replace, lithium ion battery is also very bad, they are using old lithium cells which fail after the warranty is over.
The service center is the worst, most of the time they are closed, and they get commission for servicing the scooter by tearing out the coupons and sending them to okinawa without actually servicing any scooter. Okinawa you're cheating and also getting cheated. They are using children as mechanic that is not just unethical but also illegal as they are working with 70 volts dc which is dangerous. No warranty or repair possible because dealers only sell it and don't know how to service it. The company doesn't care for its image as it's only cares about selling more and more.
Mr okinawa is a fool if he thinks he'll get rich by doing this . Tighten up your ship sir. Here's some business advice from a loser to an idiot, how does hero exist today? huh? is it because of its amazing engineering? exquisite build quality, best in class performance? nope none of those. Hero or formerly hero Honda was and is successful because it could be fixed easily and readily even though they made crap, that crap was cheap crap and that cheap crap can be easily fixed by buying some cheap crap and replacing the crapped crap part and you're good to go on your crappy bike on the crappy road to the other crappy part of this crappy country. They didn't just sell the bikes and bolted. They made service center everywhere. Even in the craphole town I call home there are 3 hero showrooms nearby and one Honda showroom but you Mr. okinawa sold about 10-15 scooters here then shut shop and went abracadabra. I can't get my front brake pads replaced so i now await my death or someone else's death because i can't have front brakes anymore. Also no rear brake warning light because life is short so okinawa policy is to make it even shorter unlike people from okinawa who live very long lives, yes I've read your bullshit business man bites from various auto media outlets.
If Mr. okinawa wants to remain in the market it'll have to improve its manners and mindset of providing proper after sales service and spares and repair, make battery station etc or okinawa will be nothing but a sigmatel, china set owners will recognize that name.
Service center is denying warranty for rear brake light switch and saying i will have to fix it elsewhere. How indian government is allowing such malpractice against consumer and buyers is appalling.
The hub motor is weak and only capable upto 50 km/h max. But the speedo shows 70 plus hilarious. The motor bearings used are so cheap that it got bent during running and now the wheel wobbles and rubs with the disc brake pads.
Fake speedometer and odometer shows exaggerated numbers.
Charging the lead acid battery takes 7 hours minimum. The lithium also takes surprisingly long about 4-5 hrs.
Battery capacity meter is also wrong doesn't show range left or energy left. There is no bms so it can go boom during charging and running. There's no battery or motor cooling so they overheat during use.
Battery meter just shows 5 bars which shows full when standing and drinks completely when running.
Suspension is un-adjustable and extremely poor, front is too soft and sags completely on sitting one person and rear is too hard and has very low travel.

they are asking 90k plus for this crap.

"I had bought the Okinawa praise model in January 2019 which was given to me by the dealer for 82000. From this it is known that the company has no control over the dealer. Dealers can rob the customer as much as they want from their mind. Since then the mileage of the bike was not as much as it is told. If we are 10 km. When the bike is running, its meter shows 13 to 14 km and the bike does not give an average of more than 100 km.
Even after showing all these faults, the dealer did not do any solution. After that, told the company all the problems on the phone and also did email but the company also did not give any response. Tired of all this, i filed my complaint with the district consumer forum Aurangabad whose number is ( cc/606/2019)
And wow i won my case. And now my complaint state consumer forum Aurangabad is here and i am sure that the forum will understand my grievance and resolve it. If anyone has such a problem like me, then he should contact me, I will definitely help. Unless we go to the customer dispute forum, the company will not know about the customer's grievance.
You can make your own complaint in the customer disputes redressal forum. And it doesn't seem like any charge is completely free.

"After taking test ride of hero and tunwal i felt okinawa praise was better than all those. Actually i wanted to buy a good looking scooter with good mileage and non of them are providing the same except okinawa praise.1. Buying experience:I bought the vehicle from sai enterprises, dhalapathar,khurda,odisha. Dealer was very helpful and was very straight forward in mentioning all the pros and cons. The total amount i paid was rs76000 for double disc brake one. 2. Riding experience:To be honest for 1-2 days i felt very awkward while driving bcoz of soundless and then finally loved it. On bumpy rides its not giving very much comfortable ride experience but in main road it's giving fine experience. I ride it daily for 80kms. Braking system is amazing with double disc.3. Details about looks & performance:I bought the glossy purpule colour and it looks amazingly well and many people always states and asks me about the vehicle mostly bcoz it's very eye catching.Charging time is actually 8-9 hours and in single charge it's giving 140kms. I have tested it and in manual also it's written maximum 150kms , so maybe 200km is for lithium version.4. Service & maintenance: Haha actually i have not gone a single time for any service but yes availed the free service by them twice , just battery rotation and few adjustments.Maintenance is actually zero in it and i'm saving a lot of fuel cost.5. Pros and cons:Pros: saves me daily rs100 and early rs36000 , in two years i will get my money back by this which is amazing.In single charge goes for 140kms with speed of 60kms that is my speed .Zero maintenance and no need to visit service centre and no need to change engine oil like that.Look is classy and with keyless start and locking and theft protection including mobile charging it's really good.Only takes 3 unit of electricity that is rs10 for my home metre.

"Worst experience, at initially i was excited to buy a drove this electric bike as a eco friendly person.However , come to personal experience The build quality of bike is poor.Cons: Will start from front to rear of bike 1) head lights of bike are like a mobile screen light at high beam, at low beam no need to say.2)handle will shake on riding, due to it's non rigidity. This will not affect more but whenever we drive on rough road it would. May it cause accident if you don't drive care fully.3) come to ignition switch (power the motor) the build quality of switches are very poor. Horn switch was damaged in first week. But luckily it have two switches. These switches are bit different we cannot adapt initially to press because it's position it's a different matter.4)major part of bike is battery backup Company mentioned it will go until 150-200 km. Thats absolutely false. May they tested on treadmillIn reality it can go only 80-100 km. With a single person. If you rode dual on bike it's comes under 85km *(initially i tested). Depends on roads. But now it's giving me only Guarantee on batteries would be 1 year.The company of batteries are not a good one..4) this is the bad experience , after drove Later on front alloy wheel was broke-in in it's spokes and pivot joint where bike will contact with tire.This is the worst one i experienced. Virtually alloy wheels won't break it self. But here it's happen . Roughly my weight would be Let's imagine if a person with 70- 80 kg i shipped my bike in a trolley to show room in the middle of the road. I have snap shots of this.5) speedo meter will cheat you, it would showing 10km extra ex: if you are on a speed of 50 it will show 60. Again trapping by company .It won't go greater than 60 - 65 on a flat road and down slope. If it is a height slope it will go under 30 -356) front disk break is attractive but don't expect performance .I rarely used that break because of it's breaking mechanism. It won't control bike speed even if you on 20km speed 7)parts of the bike loosely coupled, never know which part will go off on running bike.8) seating experience is worst if you drove 50 km you will get tired due to it's height of the foot rest Pros:There is not much more 1) no fuel 2) less running cost (maintenance).3)eco friendly.4) bike will easily pull two persons As a electric engineer i have lot of to say but this is enough to understand about this bike Buy electric bikes but not from okinawa .",Daily Commute,3-6 months,< 5000 kms,1,4,3,,5,,1,,3,Okinawa Praise

Electric vehicle for first time so this problem is arising. and one was concerned even to check the vehicle. Then on second charge time I found the battery socket was broken .I was told it will be repaired n no replacement of battery for same. Then intermittently the scooter started giving problems. Most of the times it stopped running. The dealers don’t have spares & skilled technicians to do the trouble shooting. I had even complained at the okinawa company for the problem ,they assigned a engineer who was least bothered even to see what is the issue and just asked the technician to check. Till date the vehicle still fails they don’t have a solution for same. I purchased the vehicle from auto z showroom in dombivli, If you call company customer care they are least bothered.

In reality the mileage would be 110 economic mode and 90 sport mode. When i complained about the mileage, initially they said, the battery needs atleast 10 cycles of charge, to give full mileage.. It almost went 100 cycles now.. There is no change in the mileage.. And one more thing, they promised is till 4 yr there will not be any performance drop. After 1.5 yr itself, i see drop in my mileage, despite regular service. .I really lost the trust in the okinawa scooters..

"Very very low-quality scooter.
I am completely not satisfied with the scooter and service.
1 - speedometer is totally false. If it shows 50 km/h speed, actually we are on 34 km/h speed. If the meter shows 100 km distance, actually it ran only 68 kms. The company has to call back all scooters and replace the speedometer.
2 - company says 80-90 kms per charge, it shows 90 kms per charge, but as the speedometer is faulty, your scooter ran only 60 kms per charge. So beware when you go for a 70-80 kms ride.
3 - disk breaks have noise issues. After 2 weeks I found some kind of noise from disc breaks. I went to a service station and different technicians gave me different conclusions. One said, in the rainy season, there is always noise coming from disk break. Another one said, all disc brake system in the world has noise, but in petrol scooters, it cannot be heard due to engine noise. What the rubbish technicians.
4 - sock absorbers are of very low quality. Cannot resist riding with a pillion. There is a strange kind of knocking noise from the rear shock absorbers..
5 - tubeless tyres - they are very poor quality. Once I was going with my wife and suddenly tyre got flat (no puncture). Maybe it left its grip on the drum.

"I bought my Magnus pro on the 8th of January this year. Other than the bad experience of inefficiency from the dealer’s side at the 45 time of the delivery of the vehicle, the vehicle is up to my likes. Certain demerits I would like to share about my Magnus pro are :1) The weight of the vehicle should have been a bit more than as of now because at turns, the scooter waves more than the desired angle of turn. 2) Then of course, the side & the center stand, it should have been installed with a bush punched on either stands. Because, when riding, both the stands tend to keep knocking on the chassis and gives an irritating noise especially at bumps. 3) the headlights could have been a little more powerful one. During rainfalls or when riding in a misty climate, your sight gets blurred as the led headlight even when on high beam does not have the required efficiency. I reported the same to a friend of mine and it was he who told me so that the headlight is been installed according to the battery capacity & hence I do not want to place it as a blame on ampere. 4) I happened to see the speedo cluster of the reo model ampere scooter. I was surprised to see a modern era speedo display cluster (totally multi - colored) installed on it. If the same had been been installed on Magnus pro, considering the price of Magnus pro, this product would have been an absolute hit.

1.There is an error in speedometer both speed and mileage. If you ride like 50 km distance the meter shows 60km.Every 10 km there is 20% error. So, if you drive 80km actually but it shows 100 km.
2.Top speed is only 50-55 not 60 again the meter shows the error. I have tested the range and speed with activa and pulsar, i have found the error.

The ride on this vehicle is very comfortable. I travel 50 km's daily in heavy traffic condition in Bengaluru. This vehicle is value for money. Running cost is lowest among its competitors. It is very suitable for daily city commuting. The vehicle has good looks and design and has all the basic feature that a 2 wheeler must have. One more myth about e vehicles is that it will not be able to climb steep roads. But I have tested in steep roads and while coming out of steep basement exit. Even though vehicle was stopped at the mid of climb, it managed to climb fully without any hassle. This scooter can do anything that a 110 cc scooter can do. But do keep in mind the battery charge level to avoid range anxiety. Some dealers are offering to exchange with petrol vehicles. I recommend to buy this vehicle if you have to travel within the city traffic. The dealer and the company both are oriented towards customer satisfaction. They respond to your requests immediately.

"What a disappointment! the bike arrived after many months waiting (with various delivery dates not met.) I was unable to put it together in full working order as the wrong size screw had been supplied. My husband brought the correct screw the next day as I was eager to ride the bike. I also had concerns over a congealed substance on the hub. A replacement stand (which i was told was provided because the stand on the bike has problems) was broken. After the first 4km a high pitch noise came from the hub when in pedal assist 1 and 2 and continuously when free wheeling. I returned from my bike ride and called my supplier who assured me a representative from ampere would call that day. No call was forthcoming so i called the supplier again. 2 days later i spoke with an ampere rep who agreed it was probably a problem with the hub. I was asked to take off the back wheel, pack it and return it to them (they organized pick up) this was tuesday and i was told to expect it back on thursday. I contacted ampere on the thursday to check delivery and was told it would now be friday.

Thin fiber body makes noise on uneven roads, Low suspension so have to be careful on humps, poor quality fiber and design for back wheel mudguard so got broken within 1500 km low speed drive. Center stand spring not good so it always jumps on uneven roads while driving, battery charging at home but have to charge 2-3 times with intervals to get full charge. Every time it shows it's fully charge but if you charge again after some time it takes charge. And with this trick it gives good range. Front light is so so in night to drive. Top speed is 55 when battery full charge. And will reduce to 50-51 if battery is charge less then 50%.Battery jumps a lot under the sit and the company belt is not good to hold it. With me 2 times it got broke. So last I did trick by filling stuff on top and side of battery which can hold it under the sit.

"I got to know about this brand from a comment in youtube under a review about ather450 lol. Bought ETrance neo after a lot of research. Got it delivered in 7 days after booking, using it for 2 weeks now and following is my findings and reviews about the vehicle.
Price: 88000 (on-road) accessories included-charger, mirrors, ladies handle & footrest, left side footrest and mat.
Charging time: approx. 4hrs (0-100%)
Range: 105 kms (mixed mode riding with pillions most of the time)
Since pure is a startup, there are some defects like;
1. Water gets inside the switches, especially inside the high/low beam switch with make the headlight stuck in only high beam, and when I toggle the switch the odometer gets reset into zero. (I contacted the dealer and they replaced both the switch and the display unit but the issue persists.
2. The mcb in my scooter was defective and it constantly tripped. (dealer replaced it in a day)
3. The disk brake calipers is loose and makes sound while driving. (service tech told there is nothing that can be done about it)
I test drove both hero and pure ev and from the riding experience I felt pure is much better in refinement (hero jerks a lot while accelerating initially whereas ETrance offered much more refined and stable acceleration.)
Performance and look is satisfactory.
Don't know about servicing or maintenance needed yet.
Pros:
1.Good range
2.Sufficient performance needed in a city.
3. And anything else that you can find in youtube :p
Cons:
1. Low/no storage space (battery fills the space under seat.
2. Pillion comfort is not up to the mark but superb for single riding.

I drove this scooter in heavy rain also and not faced any battery issues. Boot space is not there in my scooter and even cant keep its charger also. But this issue is resolved in recent edition of this scooter.
For one charge it takes 3 units of power and 4 hours time.
Not good for youths who likes speed. Good for people who likes economic ride.
Suspension is good but not for committed 150kg load.
Water enters switches which affects indicator and head light on/off function.
Odometer reading has difference compared to google map or any other bike or actual distance. Service person told that is because during short ride (anything less than 1km) km will not be added to total km count. Anything more than 1 km will be recorded to main km count. That's true but we will not go that short drives more often.
Over all I liked this bike and suggest others to buy.
Important suggestion: charge the battery only when it drains to at least 70 to 80% and charge 100 percent every time to get better battery life.",Daily Commute,> 1 yr,< 5000 kms,4,,,,,,,,,PURE EV ETrance Neo

I am looking to replace my daily commute scooter and need to haul kids to and from school.Here is my feedback:1) height and leg space for a rider who is almost 6 ft is ok. Can manage.2) if your kids have large backpacks then it is difficult to manage it.3) basic side accessories like ladies side handle with hook cannot be fitted without interference with battery. I do not know where to hang two lunch bags.4) not enough space in the bike to hang or store 2 kids helmet.5) pickup and speed with 2 adults was pretty good compared to other electric scooters 6) killer design issue for me: my son's shoe keeps bumping into the back of my right leg everytime i stop the bike in traffic. This is due to the design of the footrest. Effectively, i have dirty pants in the morning if this my commute vehicle. The dealer had no side footrest solution nor was he polite during the inquiry about a solution to this problem. I would have bought thus without second thought if i was in college or before having kids.Many may say that i need a car or get alternate transport for your kids but i am an average consumer and all these needs are met comfortably by other scooters.

"Personal review on my bike to help all e-bike buyers out there :I am driving ampere zeal from 23 september 2019, i risked buying ampere zeal between various marketing giants like okinawa, ather, revolt etc. I will post in most sites to reach as many as possible.Personally i have tested various bikes from okinawa, benelli, and ampere, hero in chennai. Reviews from other brands: 1. Okinawa praise series: pros: cool looks, more electricals, useful head lights, 75kmph speed, good build quality.Cons: customers review that the battery life cycle is too short and it doesn't give the mileage the company promises. reason is too heavy bike, which overloads the battery and stresses it leading to less charging cycle. (if u want okinawa wait for belt drive series like ather or revolt or yamaha so it won't stress the battery and live longer). other thing is bike and spares are too costly. (better go for ather) praise lithium battery is too costly so after three years u will throw the bike than replacing the battery.2. Okinawa ridge+: ridge and ampere zeal have matching specs and proper rivals.Pros: good electrical options than zeal (have reverse), usable head lamps, looks like usual honda dio bikes.Cons: the bike i drew dint go fast due to less charge, but i feared the battery quality like in praise. (but heavy) bikes are not enough in stock. Some reviews says company doesn't solve their customers issues and poor warranty claims. They are eager in manufacturing and sell new bike only. (suits to praise too) replacement parts takes long.3. Benelli: Pros: cheap Cons: looks like a toy electric bike, speed is less, they buy bikes from various manufacturers (Indian and chinese) and sell it in their name(like battree brand they sell under benle) spares will take too long to reach u. poor build quality, ( except battree model which is good but just looks odd check amazon)4. Ampere reo:Pros: cool looks, useful head lamps, best buy for the price (cheap), they look similar to zeal except in performance.Cons: less speed 25 or 40kmph, average build quality.5. Ather 450 and rv 400: (haven't test driven) pros: speed, pickup, and everything is best ,belt drive so battery and motor will last long.Cons: too costly bike, spares and battery we will get bugged by people for it's annoying looks. not available only registration is going on. buzzing sound. 6. Hero electrc: pros: cost effective, well known brand, Cons: average build quality, looks like crap in design (very poor looks), avearge battery quality.7. Ampere zeal:Reason for buying ampere zeal: ampere company is always true to their words, zeal looked like honda dio, company has best customer support, colors and stock always available no waiting. And mainly cheap for the price and specs. We can't drive bikes at 25kmph so i needed >50 kmph and decent mileage. It's coimbatore startup and acquired by greaves. Pros: good pick up, cool looks like commercial dio, it gives promised mileage 75km/charge at 55 kpmh speed. It gives >90 km mileage at low speeds. a cheapest bike compared to others with speed >50. simple to use, detachable battery. quality of battery and hub motor is good. less weight can drive very easy and take it in gaps of traffic very easy. spares are ready in 2 to 5 days. Cons: useless head lamp, average body plastic build quality (it will feel like a newbie designed its body), average harness and body quality, (my brake holder had poor cast iron received broken waiting still to be changed) less electrical options, charges time is 5 hours. (fast charging reduces battery life so it's good)Who can buy ampere zeal: e-bike have no exchange value, so if you are not ready to donate 1.5 lakhs to ather or okinawa or revolt but u also need speed+ performance+ battery quality choose zeal if you want a commercial looking e-bike go fort it.Note: upcoming models from hero, ampere, yamaha, bajaj are creating strong expectations.

"For online supermarket delivery business. Bought 2 zeal bikes on recommendation of a porter delivery guy who had been using it for a year. Bought it at rajajinagar, bangalore. Found out about it being owned by greaves cotton limited and made a lot of money buying shares of the company. The company is present across India and is a reliable company of more than 160 years. Yes you read that right 160. Now coming to bike, with rough use, not even serviced in last 6 months , I am fully satisfied with the bike. One has run 2500 kms, another 1700 kms. I have saved at least Rs. 4500. Now bike has started slowing a bit and that seems to be because of us not having it serviced properly. Petrol scooters now feel outdated to say the least when I tried my Jupiter or activa once in a while. We have always charged the bike by taking the battery (12 kgs) up to the second floor where we have our warehouse. Never had any issue with this. Planning to buy 2 more shortly. Happy customer :-) If there was one thing I would change in this vehicle it would. Be the headlights , they are not very effective. Rest all good and helped us save a ton of money and both bikes will be almost free in one year of usage. Let's see how the vehicle performs going forward but upto now it's been a super ride.

"After scratching my head and personally testing atleast 6 brands of ev finalized on ampere because, 1. Brand owned by greaves (indian) 2. Practical for delivering goods 3. Decent mileage 4. Nearby service centers.
I personally rode the bike for couple of days and it felt awesome riding a noiseless vehicle for the first time ever. Post that I assigned the vehicle to one of the delivery boys in my business.
The bike is made of fiber has metal guards all around - but the quality is cheaper that what we may come across other brands like tvs - Honda - hero etc. If we rate built quality of the established brands at 100 then zeal is at 60. The output of the bike has been bang on as stated by the dealer 60 km at high speed (max 54km / h) and 70km at low speed (max 27 km / h) with charging time of approx. 4 hours to full charge. Charge has a 5 amp plug so you can put it in the small sockets and get the charging going on.
The first service came within 10 days of the vehicle used (1000 kms), god knows what they do during this check up as there are hardly any parts they need to check except the battery and motor and the connectors between them. Now by the time the bike reached 1800 km it started stalling (not moving) and we faced this issue atleast 4 times. We had to push the vehicle to the center and the mechanic just tightened the connectors and the vehicle was working, as i write this review the vehicle is stalled for the 5th time and the service center is not replying to my problems. A mail has been sent to the company which has not been answered for past 5 days, the customer service is so pathetic that you loose your patience.
Apart from the mechanic no one in the whole chain - from dealer - customer service - sales - marketing know about the vehicle and so we speaking to anyone of these people is like speaking to a wall.
Plus: -
1. Budget vehicle (all incl. 70k on road in pune)
2. Decent range with decent charge time
3. Good warranty on motor and battery (3 years/30k km)
4. Good max speed for city riding
5. Low profile - so excellent for ladies and with ample foot space and boot space - so good for delivery agencies.
6. Keyless use of vehicle (controllable by remote - just like a car)
Minus:-
1. On - off noise is too loud
2. Built quality is average - can expect much more while paying 70k
3. Only noise coming from the vehicle is of the rattling of guards placed around the vehicle
4. Major fault - the distance between the left hand grip and indicator is so much that one needs to leave the grip to put on the indicator. (else you need a giant hand)
5. Recurring stalling issue - and no know how of it to anyone shows that the vehicle was launched in a rush, not keeping issues in mind. Mostly some wire is short / loose - but as no one knows how to repair it - its remains a big q for me too.
Happy that I bought a made in India vehicle, sad because is breaks down very often, hopeful because I stay in India and have faith that we will find a solution one day.",Everything,< 3 months,< 5000 kms,3,3,2,4,3,4,,3,,Ampere Zeal

"I would like to bring few issue in everybody notice that i bought nyx e-5 (registration no. Dl 9sb v7147) on 14th july 2019 from dwarka motors. I was very happy because i could save environment & money both.1. After three days lock below seat was not in working condition. When i put key to open the seat then it was moving all around. I was not able to charge the battery because charger was locked in seat. Somehow i managed to open the seat and charged the battery. Next days i went to workshop & he fixed the lock. Also he found some wires were burn near connector. He also fixed that issue on that day.2. After few days lock condition was again same. Also when i was riding the scooter on saturday evening then sound of scooter went high like sound of old buses when he use brakes. Sound was unbearable and scooter also run with lot of jerk. I called the workshop person and tell this issue. He denied to send his person but when i request him then he told that person will come next day but he will charge rs. 200 for visit. I had no option and i agree to pay rs. 200. Somehow i managed to bring scooter to workshop on sunday morning and workshop engineer found that wire was burn near connector which he fixed few days back. He changed the lock also. Also charger socket was also not working which he changed. I was totally frustrated as i wasted 3 hours.3. Same issue i faced after few days. Fortunately when i reached to workshop, two engineers was also there from hero electric and they assured me that this problem will not come again. I was too upset this time as i came 3 times in workshop with in one month.4. Now again i am feeling that brake is tight, some times sound of scooter is very high and i feel there is some issue in scooter again. It can be stop any time. 5. Also want to let you know that there is two more big problems in this scooter. It is very uncomfortable when ride. 1st issue is brake – it is too hard & looks like hero electric put cycle brakes in it. Always feel jerk when use brakes. The biggest drawback is it can’t be usable if you push break suddenly. If you are at the speed of 30-35 and use break suddenly then it will not work and you will get hurt badly. 2nd issue is shocker, looks like there is no shocker as we feel heavy jerk when it goes to broken road.6. They claim 50-60 kms in one charge but it can’t go above that 35-40 kms. You can’t compare this with another scooter because quality of this scooter is too low. I paid rs. 71k and feel i wasted my complete money after buying this. I would like to return this scooter to hero electric asap due to these issues.",Daily Commute,< 3 months,< 5000 kms,1,3,1,,2,,1,,1,Hero Electric NYX
