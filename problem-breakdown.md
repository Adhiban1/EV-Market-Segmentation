**Breakdown Steps**:

1. **Dataset Exploration**:
   - Begin by exploring each of the datasets to understand their contents, focusing on columns related to EVs, such as "Total Electric Vehicle" or similar.

2. **Data Integration**:
   - Identify common columns or fields across the datasets that can be used to link or integrate them. For example, regions or states can be common identifiers.
   - Create a master dataset or table that combines relevant information from all datasets. Ensure that the data is in a consistent format.

3. **Sampling**:
   - Select a subset of the combined dataset for estimation purposes. This subset should represent a diverse and meaningful sample of the entire dataset.

4. **Estimation**:
   - Calculate the average number of EVs per row in the sampled data.
   - Extrapolate this average to estimate the total number of EVs in India based on the entire combined dataset.
   - Keep in mind that this estimate will be a rough approximation due to data variations and sampling.

5. **Adjustments**:
   - Consider making adjustments for any biases or limitations in the data sources. For example, if certain regions or states are overrepresented or underrepresented, adjust the estimate accordingly.

6. **Final Estimate**:
   - Provide your Fermi estimate of the total number of electric vehicles in India, considering the data from multiple sources.
   - Include any assumptions or limitations in your estimate.

7. **Sensitivity Analysis**:
   - Given the uncertainties in combining multiple datasets, perform a sensitivity analysis to assess how variations in assumptions or data quality might affect the estimate.
