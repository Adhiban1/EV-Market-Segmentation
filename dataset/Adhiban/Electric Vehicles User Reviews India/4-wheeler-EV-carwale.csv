Price difference between petrol and electronic could not convince customer to buy electronic car. Difference amount can use for Life time use of petrol diesel car. Moreover long ride is big concern for charging. Only useful for fix route of almost 100 km.

Everything is ok. And I greatly appreciate Hyundai's innovation in bringing electric cars but the price for this is too much and even if the gst gets reduced it will come about 20l but there are many competitors in that range except for the electric transmission. To be successful in Indian market they should 1.Reduce the price 2.implement more electric stations around major cities 3.service should be improved incase for electric cars 4.free service should be given for at least 8 times Anyway hatsoff for Hyundai for their innovative electric car in Indian roads,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,Not Purchased,Did a short drive once,3.0,hyundai kona

Hyundai Kona Electric is extremely good car but expensive for its size and performance. We should wait for reduction in GST and road tax which is likely to reduce the price by couple of lakh rupees.

So the future of Indian cars have arrived! Hyundai certainly has heated up the competition in EV segment too now...As currently the Kona Electric is completely build unit that's why the initial cost is looking a bit high because of import tax etc..I hope that it gets upto 20 lakhs after complete manufacturing in India!

"I chose the base model, i.e., the XM variant. The car got delivered on time. In fact initially I was appraised of a waiting period of 3 months but eventually the car got delivered within 15 days only. Driving this car is as as easy as it could get. It is really smooth, noise and vibration free car. Range anxiety will be there for now, until proper infra is developed. However once one get habituated with the required driving style, i.e., feather touch with accelerator and brakes and properly using the regeneration, then this car can give mileage as high as 280km in the winter. In the summer the range drops significantly, in my case to 220-230km. Charging time is quite annoying and if someone is not having proper wiring and at least 4kw meter connection at their household, they must do it before purchasing the car. Overall the car is comfortable, rear seat and leg space quite decent, however the slight bulge at the middle of the back seat base could have been avoided. Few features like anti-glare mirror, speed sensing lock, electric ORVM, rear wiper and camera could have been added considering it to be a high value car. Although these are available in the higher variants. Also the interior could have been a bit modern. Conclusion: if your max requirement is city drive and that too at least 50-60km per day on an average, then this is the best car for you. On the other hand if you love to go for long drives then time hasn't arrived yet to switch onto electric.",4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,New,Few thousand kilometers,4.0,tata nexon ev

"After driving Nexon EV for a few times, i feel there is much more factors that really makes Tata Succeed if they plan early. Tata should lower the Nexon price and increase market share Tata Punch EV - 5-8 Lakhs Tata Nexon EV 300 km range - 8-10 Lakhs Tata Nexon EV 400 km range - 10-15 Lakhs Because, the affordability in lower range and availability in mid-range is important optional swappable range extender batteries would become a super hit like partnering with swappable battery stations.",4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,Not Purchased,Did a short drive once,5.0,tata nexon ev

We have spent our mental and physical energy in countless workshop visits, phone calls etc. Have been trying to contact Tata motors to replace the faulty vehicle, but every time they just repair something and send back. Our life has been a living hell since the day we bought this car. We got stranded thrice. Their customer service and technical team people don't pick up calls. we kept on calling. Finally 2 days back they replaced the battery pack, we thought our problems are over but no, this car won't let you sleep in peace. Now there are new issues.

Haven't faced any issues. It gives me a range of 200-220 km on full AC.

"I bought Nexon EV 2 months ago. I was always interested in electric cars therefore after examining various product and waiting after launch of each one to judge the response, we finally decided to go ""vocal for local"" and buy Nexon EV. Other rivals are better in terms of all aspects but it doesn't make any sense to buy them because though they have cheaper running cost as every electric it costs the same as buying ICE car of same segment and spending on maintenance and fuel. On the other hand Nexon offers value for money package with decent features. Approximate range according to my driving with AC ,music system etc always switched on. 1. City : 200-220 km 2. Highway: 160-175km Pros : 1. It is a good looking car and has superior build quality. I had an accident and I did not use my insurance, vehicle was in good condition on the other hand opponent's car got crushed and had to tow his vehicle. 2. Has superb ride quality and insulation. Very peaceful to drive. Has more than enough ground clearance. 3. Interior quality is up to the mark and seats are extremely comfortable. 4.Performance is superb ,sports mode is addictive for torque lovers. 5.It is a perfect primary vehicle if you have secondary vehicle. 6. It has low running cost(1-1.5 Rs/km) and no dependency of fuel station. 7.Connected features offered gives peace of mind. Cons: 1. It can't be only car to own due to under developing charging infrastructure and insufficient range. 2. Range is not sufficient for long runs more than 160 km even if you have fast charger on the way as time spend on charging is too much. Eg (Pune- Kolhapur). 3. Infotainment system is a bit laggy, reverse camera and overall resolution of screen is not as good as other brands. 4. Due to extreme torque on offer wheel spin may eat your tyres early.

When I asked to crank the engine he replied ""it's already in one condition"" it shocked me, there was pin-drop silence inside car, not a single instance of vibration. It was really wow filling.. I took a test drive, smooth start-up, great grade ability. Instant cooling, awesome music.
